A source file may start with a package declaration, All the contents of the source file are contained by the package
declared. If the package is not specified the contents of such a file belong to the default package that has no name.

Default Imports
- kotlin.*
- kotlin.annotation.*
- kotlin.collections.*
- kotlin.comparisons.*
- kotlin.io.*
- kotlin.ranges.*
- kotlin.sequences.*
- kotlin.text.*

Additional packages are imported depending on the target platform.
- jvm
  - jav.lang.*
  - kotlin.jvm.*
- js
  - kotlin.js.*

Apart from the default imports each file may contain its own import directives. The import keyword is not restrictive to
importing classes; you can also use it to import other declarations:
 - top-level functions and properties;
 - functions and properties declared in object declarations
 - enum constants.

 If a top level declaration is marked private it is private to the file it's declared in.
